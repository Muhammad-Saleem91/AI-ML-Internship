# Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing the Iris Dataset

## 📌 Overview
This task focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using the classic Iris dataset. The goal was to load, inspect, and visualize the data to understand relationships between features (Sepal/Petal dimensions) and how they distinguish different flower species.

## 📊 Key Insights
* **Separability:** The *Setosa* species is linearly separable from the others based on petal dimensions.
* **Distributions:** Petal Length shows a bimodal distribution, indicating distinct groups.
* **Outliers:** Box plots revealed specific outliers in the Sepal Width feature.
